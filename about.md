My name is Jesse Amundsen. My main focus has been solving complex geospatial problems for the last 15+ years mainly within the telecom industry. I initially worked on spatial programming for network cost models developed for clients in both the private (ex: AT&T, Verizon) and public sector (ex: FCC, State Broadband Offices). I also worked on projects related to auction models and support programs (ex: [CAF II](https://www.usac.org/high-cost/funds/caf-phase-ii/), [MF II](https://www.fcc.gov/mobility-fund-phase-ii-mf-ii)).

After a decade using locational datasets not targeted narrowly enough for the purpose of broadband reporting, I led the technical development of the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric (BSLF) ([Reference #1](https://www.costquest.com/broadband-serviceable-location-fabric/), [Reference #2](https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/5375384069659-What-is-the-Location-Fabric)). The BSLF has been implemented by agencies such as the FCC and NTIA for the purposes of broadband reporting and is used in multiple federal funding programs (ex: [BEAD](https://broadbandusa.ntia.gov/funding-programs/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program)).

Along my journey I have become highly competent in PostGIS, using it to implement the majority of the geoprocessing pipeline that generates the BSLF. I enjoy thinking through geospatial problems, spatial data science challenges, and advocating for building long-lasting complex systems out of simpler constituent parts.
