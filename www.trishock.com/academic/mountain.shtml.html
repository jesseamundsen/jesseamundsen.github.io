                   <p class="first">
                   The temperature of a mass of air determines how much moisture content it can hold. Warmer air can
                   hold more moisture than cooler air, so air masses that are very cold hold little or no
                   moisture content. Masses of air are categorized by where they originate, and where they
                   originate determines their relative temperature and their moisture content. Air masses that form over
                   water are heavily saturated since they typically form over oceans where water is abundant and are usually
                   referred to as maritime air masses. Dry air masses commonly form over large continental areas where the
                   lack of water at the surface results in the relatively arid air mass known as a continental air mass.
                   When the air mass forms in a cool (normally high latitude) region it is known as polar, conversely when
                   the air mass forms in a warm region it is referred to as tropical. Combining these two dimensions of moisture
                   availability and latitude, we find the four most common air masses: maritime polar (mP), continental polar (cP),
                   continental tropical (cT) and maritime tropical (mT).
                   </p>

                   <p>
                   Energy is transferred from different latitudes by these air masses as they flow across the surface of the earth.
                   When warm, moist air meets cool, dry air the cooler air sinks beneath the warmer air mass since it is more dense.
                   This forces the warm, moist air mass upward causing it to cool which eventually leads to the air reaching its
                   dew point. Collisions of air masses create precipitation, storms and other forms of weather, but there are other
                   methods of making an air mass reach its dew point.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   Continents are not entirely flat and the change of height on land leads to orographic lifting. As air moves, it
                   flows over the land very much like water would flow over obstacles in a stream. Changes in elevation lead to the trapping of
                   these air masses and as more and more air arrives behind the already slowed air it forces much of the air upward.
                   As we learned before, air that rises cools. As air cools, it becomes closer and closer to its dew point and
                   eventually reaches it causing clouds to form. Many mountains where moist air masses are constantly arriving receive
                   high amounts of annual rainfall. Other mountain systems only receive warm, moist air masses during
                   specific times of the year due to cyclical fluctuations caused by the direct influence of the sun (further reading:
                   ITCZ) which creates monsoon conditions during parts of the year.

                   <p class="first">
                   The rate that air changes temperature involves complicated math and has to take into account a wide range
                   of environmental factors. For the purposes of learning the two different kinds of adiabatic heating and
                   cooling are generalized to be specific constants which are used to show the relationship of air masses, along
                   with how they interact as they ascend upward or descend downward. The relationships between elevation are
                   preserved which means the given examples are representative of a real-world situation but not precise.

                   <p>
                   If air is not saturated, it will cool as it rises at a rate of approximately 10&deg;C/km as it ascends.
                   Air cools as it rises due to atmospheric pressure dropping with height. The higher the altitude,
                   the less amount of air matter is above applying force downward which leads to cooling. This process is abbreviated
                   as "DALR" which stands for "Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate". The dew point of air that is rising remains relatively
                   the same as altitude increases. This allows the air to meet its dew point as the air cools at the DALR which
                   leads to the formation of clouds, fog and eventually rain. After air has reached its dew point it continues
                   to cool as it rises upward, but it does so at a slower rate known as the "WALR" which stands for "Wet Adiabatic
                   Lapse Rate" and is about half the DALR making it about 5&deg;C per kilometer. It is sometimes known as the "SALR"
                   where the "S" stands for "Saturated".

                   <p>
                   Where air meets its dew point as it ascends is known as the "LCL" (Lifting Condensation Level). The LCL is where
                   cloud bases will form since below that point the water will not form droplets, thus preventing clouds from forming.
                   Above the LCL, larger droplets will form and eventually fall if forced upwards high enough. This is important
                   since it leads to the creation of deserts in some locations and very wet conditions elsewhere.

                   The processes of adiabatic heating and cooling alongside the tremendous size and scale of many mountain ranges
                   across the globe lead to the creation of deserts. Some deserts are formed by extremely large high pressure cells
                   which dominate year-round while other deserts are formed by their large distances from sources of water. The effects
                   of orographic lifting can create deserts known as rainshadow deserts which are close to water and are not plagued
                   by the presence of a large high pressure cell year-round.

                   <p>
                   As air arrives on the windward side of a mountain range, it is forced upward and loses most of its moisture content
                   in the form of rain on the windward side of the mountain range. On the leeward side of the mountains, the air descends
                   and warms at the DALR since nearly all of the moisture had been removed from it on the windward side of the mountains.
                   Eventually, the air reaches ground level and is hot and arid, unlike when it arrived on the windward side of the
                   range. Situations like this make great examples to show how adiabatic processes work and how orographic lifting
                   changes landscapes. Sometimes referred to simply as "The Mountain Problem" it is a classic example used to display
                   the relationships of the DALR, WALR and how the dew point of an air mass determines the LCL.
                   </p>
               
               <h4><a id="example">Simplified Example</a></h4>
               <div class="divider"></div>
               
                   <p class="first">
                   Pretend we have a mountain that has a peak altitude of 2500 meters and a mass of air with a temperature of 25&deg;C
                   and a dew point of 13&deg;C. As the air rises over the mountain, its temperature changes at the DALR (10&deg;C/km or 5&deg;C/km)
                   while the dew point does not change since the amount of moisture currently in the cloud remains the same.
                   In this given example, the temperature and dew point equal each other at 1200 meters. Cloud bases will be found
                   at this altitude and moisture will be driven out of the cloud and fall on this windward slope. Both the temperature
                   and dew point continue to drop at the WALR since the air is fully saturated at this point (it can hold no more moisture)
                   and at 2500 meters they are both 5.5&deg;C.
                   </p>
                   <div class="center" style="width: 475px"><img alt="mountain" src="images/mountain.png" /></div>
                   <p>
                   As the air descends on the leeward side of the mountain the temperature increases at the DALR since it is no longer
                   fully saturated. This is because the rate that the dew point changes as it descends is around 2&deg;C/km which is less than
                   the DALR of 5&deg;C/km. The rate that the dew point changes as it descends is actually a complicated relationship and
                   is set as a static value for the simplification of the problem. When the air arrives at the same elevation it began at
                   it is 30.5&deg;C with a dew point of 10.5&deg;C. This air is warmer and more arid than the air that originally began its journey
                   over the mountain. The higher the mountain, the more moisture will be forced out of the air as it rises and cools which
                   then leads to even more arid air on the leeward side.
                   </p>
               
               <h4><a id="why">Why do the DALR and WALR differ?</a></h4>
               <div class="divider"></div>
               
                   <p class="first">
                   When a given air parcel rises and cools (at the DALR) there is a chance that it will cool to its dew point.
                   This altitude is known as the LCL (Lifting Condensation Level). After this point the air parcel is saturated
                   and cools at a slower rate (the WALR). This is because air is a gas and the water held
                   in it is in the form of vapor. When the water was changed from a solid or liquid into a gas it required
                   energy to change states. Now, in the atmosphere, the gas (water vapor) is changed back to a liquid and
                   releases the energy (previously required to turn it into a vapor) in the form of heat. This warms the
                   air parcel and continues to happen as the cloud rises and converts more vapor into liquid. This is why the
                   DALR differs from the WALR and why the WALR is less than the DALR.
